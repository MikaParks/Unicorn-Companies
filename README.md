##### Analysis
 
The number of unicorn companies significantly increased from 2020 to 2021 accross all industries except Travel, Mobile and telecommunications, and Auto and transportation. This is most likely due to covid when travel was limited. The decrease in Mobile and telecommunications would have been impacted by the increase in Internet software and services. This industry increased its number of unicorns by 495%. 

In 2021, investors who funded Auto and transportation, Internet software and services, as well as Hardware saw the hightest return on investment. With each industry bringing in 86%, 82%, and 81% respectively. However Data Management and Analytics and Fintech also saw a ROI above 80%. 

Pre-pandemic returns for these industries were still over 80% despite the low volume of companies claiming unicorn status. It should be noted that retail and cybersecurity also realized between 70-80% returns before 2020. 

Negitive returns were seen after 2020, during the pandemic, for E-commerce and direct-to-consumer as well as Supply chain, logistics, and delivery. Prior to that, neagtive returns were observed in Supply chain, logistics, and delivery as well as Auto and transportation. Outside of these industries the lowest ROI for 2021 is 30%. 

Fintech and Internet software and services have the most unicorn companies as of 2021, 138 and 119 respectively. This possibly leaves both industries overweight. 

There is no correlation between number of years companies were established and their ROI. However, it should be noted that the average is between 4-6 years. 

##### Insights

In a post pandemic world E-commerce and direct-to-consumer, Supply chain, logistics, and delivery, and Fintech carry the most risk.

While the Internet software and services as well as Data Management and Analytics industries have seen significant growth in the number of unicorns, they have also maintained an average ROI above 80% for 2018-2021. 

Edtech and Health see aproximately 70%-80% stable returns from 2015-2021. There is room for growth within these industries due to the increased demand by employees for remote work and increased advances in precision medicine. 

While Hardware has also seen aproximately 70%-80% stable returns from 2015-2021, the current high interest rates in the housing market and the return to work push from employers should also be taken into account.

Even through there is no correkation between the number of years companies were established and their ROI, that along with the company's financials should be taken into consideration and weighed accordingly.
