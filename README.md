 ##### Analysis
 
The number of unicorn companies significantly increased from 2020 to 2021 accross all sectors except Travel, Mobile and Telecommunications, and Auto and Transportation. This is most likely due to covid when travel was limited. The decrease in mobile and telecommunications would have been impacted by the increase in Internet software and services. This sector increased its number of unicorns by 495%. 

In 2021, investors who funded Auto and transportation, Internet software and services, as well as Hardware saw the hightest return on investment. With each industry bringing in 86%, 82%, and 81% respectively. However Data Management and Analytics and Fintech also saw a ROI above 80%. 

Pre-pandemic returns for these industries were still over 80% despite the low volume of companies claiming unicorn status. It should be noted that retail and cybersecurity also realized between 70-80% returns before 2020. 

Fintech and Internet software and services have the most unicorn companies as of 2021, 138 and 119 respectively. This leaves both sectors overweight and riskier investment choices.
